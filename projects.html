        <h2>Comparison of Performance of Machine Learning models</h2>
        <p>
            UCI Breast Cancer Dataset is used for this performance comparision of KNN, SVM, Random Forest models. 
            Three classifiers are chosen to predict if the tumors are malignant or not and their performance is evaluated.
            Reported Cross-validated F1, precision, and recall scores for each classifier.

          <h2> simple-and-multiple-linear-regression-model-using-diabetes-dataset </h2>
          <p>
              Simple and multiple linear regression models are built and their MSE, R-squared, and Coefficeints are reported.

        <h2> Regression-Models-Performance-Evaluation-Using-R-square-score </h2>
        <p>
            Multiple_regression, polynomial regression, support_vector_regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree models are built 
            on a classic dataset. Evaluated and compared the performance of different regression models using R square score. 
            The closer the R-Square to one, the better is the regression model.The data set(Data.csv) has four features average temperature, vaccum, pressure and humidity and we predict the energy output.

        <h2> Profit prediction of a company using multiple linear regression </h2>
        <p>
            50_startups.csv dataset is used for this predition. The independent features are R&D spend, Administration, Marketing, state and dependent variable is profit.
            Data consists of categorical values, so they are converted to numeric using OneHotEncoding. Multiple_regression model is built and visualized.

        <h2> Predicting-Employee-salary-based-on-experience-using-Simple-Linear-Regression </h2>
        <p>
            Salary.csv dataset is used to build a simple linear regression model which has employee experience and salary as attributes.
