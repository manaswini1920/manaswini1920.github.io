    <h1 style="text-align: center">About</h1>
    <p> I am the kind of person who would like to take up the responsibilities and implement them with perfection.
        I have developed this trait since my schooling and developed an interest in problem-solving.
        My interest in problem-solving led me to take up computer science as my major in undergrad Studies.
        The projects I worked on during my bachelor’s degree,created an interest inside me to gain more knowledge i
        n Machine Learning, Full-stack development. During my bachelor’s degree, I worked as an Android developer where I worked
        on UI/UX design, design planning according to given requirements, google firebase integration. Also worked as an Intern
        Infrastructure Engineer at Pragma Edge, where I worked on B2B, EDI projects under big data platform, server deployment,
        Hadoop services maintenance and resolved Hadoop cluster issues, improved operations, and provided exceptional client support.
        I worked on building Machine Learning models and have been working as a Teaching Assistant for Network-Based Application
        Development Course from May 2021, where designing course content, teaching, and evaluating lab and projects includes my work,
        So I have been brushing up my skills in MEAN and MERN stack with D3 Js visualization. </p>
    <p>
        In Masters, I have the opportunity to develop several academic projects to gain hands-on experience on technology and to understand concept clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
        My professional work experience involves working with IT professionals on multiple Mobile Development, Web development and product based software development projects.
